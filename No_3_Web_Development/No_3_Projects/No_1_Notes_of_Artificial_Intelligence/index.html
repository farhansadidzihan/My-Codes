            <h2> <i> Revolution of Artificial Intelligence </i> </h2>
            <ul class="Revolution">
                <li> <i> Talos: </i> Talos was a giant animated bronze warrior, who was programmed to guird the Island of Crete. </li>
                <li> <i> 1950: </i> Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In the paper, Turing—famous for breaking the Nazi's ENIGMA code during WWII—proposes to answer the question 'can machines think?' and introduces the Turing Test to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence (or the results of the same intelligence) as a human. The value of the Turing test has been debated ever since. </li>
                <li> <i> 1951: </i> Game AI - By using the Ferranti Mark 1 Machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for Chess. </li>
                <li> <i> 1956: </i> John McCarthy coins the term 'artificial intelligence' at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy would go on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI software program. </li>
                <li> <i> 1959: </i> The first AI lab MIT AI Lab was set up. </li>
                <li> <i> 1960: </i> First Robot was introduced by General Motors Assembly Line. </li>
                <li> <i> 1961: </i> The first chatbot called ELIZA was invented. </li>
                <li> <i> 1967: </i> Frank Rosenblatt builds the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that 'learned' though trial and error. Just a year later, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert publish a book titled Perceptrons, which becomes both the landmark work on neural networks and, at least for a while, an argument against future neural network research projects. </li>
                <li> <i> 1980: </i> Neural networks which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself become widely used in AI applications. </li>
                <li> <i> 1997: </i> IBM's Deep Blue beats then world chess champion Garry Kasparov, in a chess match (and rematch). </li>
                <li> <i> 2005: </i> Stanford Racing Team's robotic car, Stanley wins the DARPA Grand Challenge. </li>
                <li> <i> 2011: </i> IBM Watson beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy! </li>
                <li> <i> 2015: </i> Baidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special kind of deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human. </li>
                <li> <i> 2016: </i> DeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves!). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million. </li>
            </ul>

                <h3> <i> What is AI </i> </h3>
                <i> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. 
                    AI is achieved through the creation of algorithms and mathematical models that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require 
                    human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
                </i>
                <h3> <i> Types of AI </i> </h3>
                <ul class="Types">
                    <i> Artificial Narrow Intelligence - Weak AI like:- <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" class="ChatGPT"> Chat GPT</a>, Siri, Alexa etc. </i> 
                    <br>
                    <i> Artificial General Intelligence - Strong AI - AlphaGo can be considered </i>
                    <br>
                    <i> Artificial Super Intelligence - Super AI - Not Invented Yet </i>
