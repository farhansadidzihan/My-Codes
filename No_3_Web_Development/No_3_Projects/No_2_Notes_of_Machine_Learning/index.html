            <h2> <i> History of Machine Learning </i> </h2>
            <p class="ML_History">
                Machine learning (ML) has roots in the 1940s and 1950s, with early developments in pattern recognition and computer science.
                In the mid-1980s, ML became a separate field of study, with the introduction of decision tree algorithms and the Bayesian approach. 
                The 1990s saw advancements in algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The rise of big data 
                and increased computational power in the 2000s led to the development of deep learning algorithms and increased interest in ML. 
                Today, ML is a rapidly growing field with numerous applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.

                Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data to make predictions or take actions based on input data. 
                The algorithm uses the labeled data to learn the relationship between the input variables and the output variables and then generalizes this relationship to 
                make predictions on new unseen data. In supervised learning, there is an expected output provided for each input example. Examples include classification and

            <p class="Unupervised_Learning">
                Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is not given labeled data, and instead is asked to find patterns and relationships in the data without any guidance. 
                The goal is to uncover the underlying structure of the data by clustering similar examples together, reducing the dimensionality of the data, or identifying anomaly and outliers. 
                Common unsupervised learning algorithms include K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Autoencoders.

                    <li> 
                        K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering, which means it is used to find groups of similar objects within a large data set. 
                        The idea behind K-means is to partition the data into K distinct clusters based on the similarity of their features. Each cluster is represented 
                        by its mean, also known as the centroid, and each object is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid.

            <h2> Reinforcement Learning </h2>
            <p class="Reinforcement_Learning">
                Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment to maximize a reward signal. In RL, 
                the learning process is modeled as a sequence of decisions, with each decision determined by a policy that maps the current state of the environment to an action to be taken. 
                The agent receives feedback in the form of a reward signal that indicates how well the action it took led to the desired outcome. Over time, the agent learns to refine 
                its policy so as to achieve the highest cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide range of problems, including game playing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
            <ul class="Reinforcement_Learning_Terms"> <h2> Reinforcement Learning Terminologies </h2> 
                <li> Agent : The Reinforcement Learning algorithm that learns from the trial and error. </li>
                <li> Environment : The world through which the agent moves. </li>
                <li> Action : All the possible steps that the agent can take. </li>
                <li> State : Current condition returned by the environment. </li>
                <li> Reward : An instant return from the environment to apprise the last action. </li>
                <li> Policy : The approch that the agent uses to determine the next action based on the current state. </li>
                <li> Value : The expected long term return with discount, as opposed to the short term reward. </li>
                <li> Action-Value : This similar to Value, except, it takes an extra parameter, the current action. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="Reinforcement_Learning_Concepts"> <h2> Reinforcement Learning Concepts </h2>
                <li> <h3> Reward Maximization </h3>
                    Reward Maximization theory states that, a Reinforcement Learning agent must be trained in such a way that, he takes the best action so that the reward is maximum.
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Exploration </h3>
                    Exploration is about exploring and capturing more information about an environment.
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Exploitaton </h3>
                    Exploitaton is about using the already known exploited information to heighten the rewards.
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Markov's Decision Process </h3>
                    The mathematical approach for mapping a solution in Reinforcement Learning is called Markov's Decision Process (MDP).

            <ul class="Reinforcement_Learning_Algos"> <h2> Reinforcement Learning Algorithm </h2>
                <li> <h3> Q-Learning </h3>
                    <li>
                        In Q-Learning, the algorithm attempts to learn the maximum expected reward for each action in each state, represented by a value called the Q-value. 
                        The Q-value for each action-state pair is updated after each interaction with the environment, using the observed reward and the estimated maximum expected 
                        reward for the subsequent state. The algorithm updates the Q-values using the Bellman equation, which provides a mathematical relationship between the 
                        current and future rewards.
                    </li>
                    <li> The following equation is used to represent a Q-learning Formulae : Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α * (r + γ * max_a(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a)) </li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="Limitations"> <h2> Limitation of Machine Learning </h2> 
                <li> <h3> Data quality </h3>
                    Machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased, incomplete, or 
                    of low quality, the model's performance will suffer. 
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Overftting </h3>
                    Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. 
                    This is a common problem in machine learning, and can be addressed through techniques such as cross-validation and regularization. 
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Lack of interpretability </h3>
                    Many machine learning models, particularly those in deep learning, are considered black boxes. This means that it can be difficult to understand 
                    how the model arrived at its predictions, which can be a barrier to its adoption in certain fields where interpretability is important, such as 
                    healthcare or finance.
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Computational cost </h3>
                    Some machine learning algorithms are computationally expensive, requiring significant amounts of memory and processing power. This can be a challenge 
                    when working with large datasets or in real-time applications.
                </li>
                <li> <h3> Human bias </h3>
                    If the data used to train a machine learning model reflects human biases, the model may reinforce and even amplify these biases. It is important to be 
                    aware of and address potential biases in the data to ensure that the model's predictions are fair and unbiased.
