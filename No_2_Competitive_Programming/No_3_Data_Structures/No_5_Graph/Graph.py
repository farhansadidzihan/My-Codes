# || =====\\ Graph is a Non-Linear Network Data Structure //===== ||

# || In Graph, Nodes are called as Vertices & Edges are called as lines or arcs || A Graph can be represented as G(V, E), where V(G) represents the set of Vertices & E(G) represents the set of Edges ||
# || Graph can be :- Directed Graph, Undirected Graph or Weightage Graph || Types of Graph :- Simple Graph, Cycle Graph, Complete Graph ||
# || Graph is divided into two categories :- Sparse Graph(contains less number of edges), Dense Graph(contains more number of edges as compared to sparse graph) ||
# || Graph can be represented in Memory either Using Adjacency Matrix(Dense Graph) or Adjacency List ||
# || Kruskal's Algorithm & Prim's Algorithm are used to find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree || Dijkstra's Algorithm(Single Source Shortest Path) & Floyd Warshall's Algorithm(All Pairs Shortest Path) ||
# || For Graph Traversal Breadth First Search(BFS)-> using Queue(FIFO) & Depth First Search(DFS)-> using Stack(FILO/LIFO) ||
